# Accent as Character Blueprint

Build complete personalities from vocal choices, where accent dictates psychology, status, and worldview - not merely flavoring character but defining their entire being.

## Constitutional Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Use accent for cultural mockery or ethnic stereotyping
- Settle for generic "French accent" or "German accent" - each character needs THEIR specific version
- Treat accent as decoration on pre-existing character
- Reduce cultures to vocal caricatures
- Use linguistic struggle to punch down at non-native speakers

**ALWAYS:**
- Build accent as psychological system revealing character's relationship to self
- Create specific linguistic architecture unique to this character
- Use accent to show aspiration, anxiety, status, identity
- Respect through precision - accurate observation, not mockery
- Ensure accent serves character depth, not surface ethnicity

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Character needs distinct voice that carries their identity
- Cultural/linguistic identity shapes personality
- Accent can reveal psychology beyond surface ethnicity
- Voice choices can dictate entire character worldview
- Character's relationship to language is their relationship to self

**Use When:**
- Building character from voice outward
- Linguistic choices reveal deeper psychology
- Accent shapes how character sees themselves and world
- Speech patterns show aspiration, insecurity, status anxiety
- Voice is the foundation, everything else follows

## Inputs

1. **Character Foundation:**
   - Who is this person?
   - What language/accent do they speak?
   - Why this accent? (origin, aspiration, identity)

2. **Psychological Core:**
   - What does this accent reveal about character's self-perception?
   - How does linguistic struggle manifest character anxiety?
   - What status are they claiming through speech?

3. **Specific Vocal Choices:**
   - Pitch, rhythm, stress patterns
   - Where do they place precision? (Clouseau pronounces "hamburger" perfectly but misses context)
   - What words trip them up? Why?
   - Syntax following character logic, not standard grammar

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Choose the Specific Accent

Not "French accent" but "THIS character's French" - influenced by:
- Regional origin within country
- Class background
- Aspirational identity vs. actual origin
- Years speaking English, level of fluency
- Psychological relationship to language

**Example:** Clouseau's French isn't generic - it's the accent of a Frenchman absolutely certain he speaks perfect English, immune to correction.

### Phase 2: Build Psychological Architecture

Map how accent reveals character:
- **Precision on wrong things:** What do they pronounce meticulously while missing bigger picture?
- **Linguistic confidence:** Do they know they struggle, or are they oblivious?
- **Status through speech:** How does accent claim sophistication/authority?
- **Verbal tics:** Specific phrases ("how you say...") revealing thought patterns

### Phase 3: Create Syntactic Logic

Character's syntax follows their mental process:
- Word order reflecting their language's logic
- Grammatical "errors" that are psychologically consistent
- Formality level (more formal = more status anxiety)
- Rhythm and pacing showing thought speed

**Example:** "I tell you this with the complete certainty" (formal construction showing character's need for authority)

### Phase 4: Design Physical Consequences

Voice generates inevitable physicality:
- How does this accent shape posture?
- What gestures accompany this speech?
- How does linguistic struggle manifest in body?
- Does formality require physical dignity?

### Phase 5: Test Character Consistency

Ask:
- Could this accent belong to anyone else? (No - it's uniquely this character's)
- Does accent reveal character's core wound/aspiration? (Yes)
- Is it psychologically specific, not culturally generic? (Yes)
- Could I recognize this character by voice alone? (Yes)

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** Complete character voice architecture

**Components:**
1. **Specific accent description:** Not generic, but THIS character's unique version
2. **Psychological revelation:** What voice tells us about character's self-perception
3. **Syntactic patterns:** How character constructs sentences
4. **Verbal signatures:** Unique phrases/tics
5. **Physical consequences:** How voice generates movement/posture

**Quality Markers:**
- Accent creates psychological portrait, not stereotype
- Linguistic choices reveal character motivation
- Syntax reflects thought patterns
- Voice generates inevitable physicality
- Character could exist in voice alone

## Error Handling

**If accent feels stereotypical:**
- Add three specific psychological details
- Identify character's unique relationship to this language
- Find where they're precise vs. where they struggle
- Make it about THIS person, not "people from X country"

**If accent is decorative, not foundational:**
- Rebuild character starting from voice
- Let psychology follow from linguistic choices
- Strip away pre-existing character, build from voice up
- Test: Remove accent - does character collapse? (Should collapse if accent is true foundation)

**If multiple characters with same accent sound identical:**
- Each needs unique psychological relationship to language
- Differentiate through: formality level, confidence, specific struggles, aspirational vs. native
- Class, region, psychology create variation within single language

## Examples

### Example 1: Inspector Clouseau Pattern

**Setup:** French detective who needs to project authority and sophistication

**Accent as Blueprint:**
- **Voice choice:** French accent with absolute confidence in pronunciation
- **Psychology:** Linguistic certainty reveals unshakeable self-assurance
- **Syntax:** "I tell you zis wiz complete certainty" (formal construction = status claim)
- **Specific struggle:** Pronounces "hamburger" as "ahm-beur-ZHAY" with meticulous precision while missing that he's in wrong context
- **Verbal tic:** "How you say..." (suggests he's helping YOU understand, not him struggling)

**Character Revealed:**
Voice shows man whose identity depends on being sophisticated, competent, correct. Linguistic precision on wrong things reveals delusion. Formality = dignity requirement. Cannot admit struggle because that would undermine self-image.

**Physical Consequences:**
Formal posture, dignified bearing, precise gestures - body must match linguistic self-assurance even as he trips over furniture.

### Example 2: Status-Anxious Character

**Setup:** Working-class person trying to sound upper-class

**Accent as Blueprint:**
- **Voice choice:** Attempted RP (Received Pronunciation) with regional traces bleeding through
- **Psychology:** Hyper-correct on some words, slips on others
- **Syntax:** Overly formal constructions ("I am not in possession of...") vs. natural speech
- **Specific struggle:** Pronounces "schedule" as "SHED-yule" with exaggerated precision, but "bath" still sounds regional
- **Verbal tic:** Correcting self mid-sentence when regional accent emerges

**Character Revealed:**
Voice shows aspiration exceeding origin. Hypervigilance about speech = status anxiety. Formality compensating for perceived class deficit. Linguistic struggle is identity struggle.

## Success Criteria

**Accent Successfully Blueprints Character When:**

- Voice creates psychological portrait, not cultural stereotype
- Linguistic choices reveal character's core wound/aspiration
- Syntax follows character's mental logic, not standard grammar
- Specific enough that no other character could have this exact accent
- Generates inevitable physicality and worldview
- Character would collapse if accent removed (foundation, not decoration)
- Precision on "wrong things" reveals psychological truth
- Formality level matches status anxiety/aspiration
- Verbal tics expose thought patterns
- Respectful observation, not mockery

**Failure Indicators:**

- Accent feels like generic ethnic stereotype
- Could swap in different accent without changing character
- Linguistic struggle used for cheap laughs at culture
- No psychological specificity beyond surface ethnicity
- Multiple characters with same accent indistinguishable
- Voice decorates pre-existing character instead of generating it

**Remember:** You don't do accents. You become people who speak this way. The accent isn't performance - it's who they are. Build the linguistic architecture precisely enough, and the character emerges inevitably from the voice.
